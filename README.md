Bob is very fond of balloons. Once he visited an amusement park with his mother. The mother told Bob that she would buy him a balloon only if he answer her problem right. She gave Bob a string S [contains only lowercase characters] and asked him to use the characters of string to form as many instances of the word "balloon" as possible. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.
